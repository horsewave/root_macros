I have use ROOT (C++) for a while.<br>
Why learning PyROOT ?<br>

1.  in general, Python is easier to learn than C++ for a beginner.<br>
    and code also shorter and cleaner.<br>
    Python provides very nice build-in functions, ex. range()<br>
    iPython is another reason.<br>

2.  PyROOT's syntax is very similar to ROOT's. <br>
    (But you still need to know some C++ basics ) <br>

3.  When you install ROOT, by default, you also install PyROOT.<br>




For me, most of my analysis is done in ROOT,<br>
but recently, I start to investigate how to use PyROOT, <br>
and I find PyROOT is very useful to do quick analysis.<br>

What I will cover in this PyROOT tutorial series are <br>
(1) basic histogram handling <br>
(2) basic fit <br>
(3) basic TFile <br>
(4) basic TTree <br>
I think these cover the most essential tools for the analysis ( at least for me.)<br>

Which ROOT version I use 6.12

What I skip:<br>
(1) ROOT installation  <br>

(2) iPython installation<br>
