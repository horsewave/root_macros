Descript:  How to c++ or c script in root

Instead of having Cling interpret your script there is a way to have your scripts compiled, linked and dynamically
loaded using the C++ compiler and linker. The advantage of this is that your scripts will run with the speed of
compiled C++ and that you can use language constructs that are not fully supported by Cling. On the other hand, you
cannot use any Cling shortcuts (see “C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting” above) and for small scripts, the overhead of
the compile/link cycle might be larger than just executing the script in the interpreter.
ACLiC will build a dictionary and a shared library from your C++ script, using the compiler and the compiler options
that were used to compile the ROOT executable. You do not have to write a Makefile remembering the correct compiler
options, and you do not have to exit ROOT.
